# British Airways Data Science Forage Program ‚Äì Task 1 & Task 2

This repository contains my solutions to both tasks in the **British Airways Data Science Forage program**, designed to simulate real-world data science challenges at a major airline.

- **Task 1**: Scraping and analyzing customer reviews from Skytrax
- **Task 2**: Building a predictive model to determine whether a customer completes their flight booking

## üéØ Objectives

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Customer Feedback Analysis
The goal was to:
- Scrape customer reviews from [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/ )
- Clean and analyze the text data using NLP techniques
- Visualize sentiment trends, frequent words, and topics
- Summarize findings into a single PowerPoint slide

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Predictive Modeling of Customer Bookings
The goal was to:
- Explore and prepare customer booking data
- Train a machine learning model to predict if a customer completes a booking
- Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC
- Visualize feature importance
- Present findings in a single PowerPoint slide

## üìä Key Insights

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Customer Feedback
- High overall sentiment scores indicate general customer satisfaction.
- Frequent positive mentions: "friendly crew", "good service".
- Common complaints: flight delays, food quality, seating comfort.
- Wordclouds and sentiment distributions highlight key themes.

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Booking Prediction
- Trained a Random Forest classifier with ~90% accuracy.
- Top predictors:
  - `purchase_lead` (how early the customer booked)
  - `wants_extra_baggage`
  - `wants_in_flight_meals`
- Customers who added extra services were more likely to complete bookings.
- ROC AUC score of ~0.89 shows strong predictive power.

### Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas textblob wordcloud matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn python-pptx
```
### Step 3: Run the notebooks
Open either:

- notebooks/scrape_and_analyze_reviews.ipynb (for Task 1)
- notebooks/booking_model.ipynb (for Task 2)
Run all cells to reproduce results and generate visuals and summary slides.
